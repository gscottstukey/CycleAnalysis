#Ghost Rider
###A novel prediction for cycling performance.

##Project Summary
This app is used to make predictions for cyclist's performances on any course based on past data (taken from [Strava](https://strava.com)). The app uses predictions on past rides to develop a novel performance metric for cyclists. Users can add themselves or other users to *_any ride_* to see how they stack up against their peers. A dynamic, in-ride pacing tool also provides instant feedback on a rider's performance and allows the rider to adjust their pace dynamically, and intelligently.

I am writing to apply for the Data Scientist position now available with the Philadelphia 76ers data science team.

My background in electrical engineering, where I have both a B.S. and M.S. degree, has given me the rigorous math, programming, and computational tools required to succeed as a data scientist. Due to my passion for sports analytics, I recently made the decision to pursue a career in data science and am currently attending a three month data science bootcamp at Zipfian Academy.

I spent most of my free time in the last three years working on sports analytics. I used play-by-play statistics from all 351 NCAA men's basketball teams to find unique insights to teams' styles, habits, and outcomes. Growing up in the basketball-centric state of Indiana, I have always been passionate about basketball on all levels. I used my knowledge of statistics and basketball to contribute to a popular Indiana University basketball blogging platform: www.insidethehall.com.

The amount of my own free time that I have contributed to sports analytics combined with the fact that I left my job to pursue a career in data science shows that I am extremely passionate about my future career.

I have strong skills in Python programming, SQL databases, javascript for data visualization, machine learning, linear algebra (extensive MATLAB experience), and statistics.

I have a rigorous academic background, applied skills in the sports analytics domain, a great passion for basketball, and am motivated to follow my dream of revolutionizing the sports analytics field. I am sure that no other candidate can match my work ethic and passion in this field.

Please contact me with any questions at (775)-720-1348.

Respectfully,

Seth Hendrickson
